# Blogchain Frontend Example Substrate

Customized frontend for an [example app with Substrate](https://github.com/zupzup/blogchain-example-substrate).

Forked from [Substrate Frontend Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) and customized.

To run simply execute `yarn start`

When the Substrate app (Blogchain) is running, this will open a new tab in your browser pointed at http://localhost:8000/
